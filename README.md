# EKS_AWS_TASK

Amazon EKS is a managed service that helps make it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS. Through EKS, organizations can run Kubernetes without installing and operating a Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. Simply put, EKS is a managed containers-as-a-service (CaaS) that drastically simplifies Kubernetes deployment on AWS.

In this task, I have created a multi-node EKS cluster on AWS. And then, I have deployed Joomla (a Content management system) and MySQL (a Database system) on the top of the cluster. 

Joomla is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing web content, developed by Open Source Matters, Inc. It is built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).

Here are the objectives of the task:

At first, a multi-node EKS cluster is to be created on the top of AWS. 

And then, two services, namely Joomla and MySQL are to be launched in that multi node cluster. 

Both the services will be getting persistent storage from the EFS service of AWS. 

And, the Joomla service is to be exposed to the public world using the Load Balancer (ELB) service of AWS.
